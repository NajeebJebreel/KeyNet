# KeyNet


The source code is under refinement, and will be uploaded soon to this repository.

This repository provides a PyTorch implementation of the paper KeyNet: An Asymmetric Key-Style Framework forWatermarking Deep Learning Models. This repository provides scripts for watermarking neural networks by fine tuning a pre-trained model or by embedding the watermark from scratch.
